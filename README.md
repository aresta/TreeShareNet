# TreeShareNet
## At the moment this is a proof of concept of a decentralized and anonymous sharing network.

Main goals are:
* Any node can anonymously:
 * share files.
 * search for files and for 'chunks' of the files
 * download files.
* It's not posible, even by multiple malicious nodes:
 * to find out who is sharing anything, even by multiple malicious nodes.
 * to find out who is searching anything, even by multiple malicious nodes.
 * to find out who is receiving anything, even by multiple malicious nodes.
* Prevent weakness by traffic analysis combined with malicious nodes should be posible to greatly mitigate.
