# TreeShareNet
## At the moment this is a proof of concept of a decentralized and anonymous sharing network.

Main goals are:
* Any node can anonymously:
  * share files.
  * search for files and for 'chunks' of the files
  * download files.
* It's not posible, even for multiple malicious nodes:
  * to find out who is sharing anything.
  * to find out who is searching anything.
  * to find out who is receiving anything.
* Prevent weakness by traffic analysis combined with malicious nodes should be posible to greatly mitigate.
